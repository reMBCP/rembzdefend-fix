# ZimperiumShxt Workaround for MB Bank

## Why this appears ?
- Because FUCK Zimperium, they didn't respect our freedom and privacy by blocking rooted devices (KernelSU/Magisk/APatch), device with custom ROMs, device using LSPosed, device with accessibility apps enabled

## How this was done
- We used `patchelf`.

## Source code
- We won't public these changes as this might lead app Developer to fix them. If MB Bank Dev seeing this, FUCK YOU BITCH, YOU DIDN'T RESPECT FREEDOM OF ANYONE !!!!
